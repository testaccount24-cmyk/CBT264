ASSEMBLING UNDOCUMENTED IBM CONTROL BLOCKS:  (And changing IBM ones)

1.  Included in this pds is the SHOWMACS member from CBT Tape File 492
    which contains macro descriptions of many IBM control blocks.  One
    would think that if one includes this library in the SYSLIB
    concatenation in the LOOK assembly, and the macro descriptions
    are added to CBMACS, then one can easily format ALL of these
    undocumented IBM control blocks.

2.  The truth is that this might not happen.  One must be very careful
    about the label names in each macro.  They should not be too long.
    Each label name should be no more than 8 characters longer than
    the macro prefix, preferably a maximum of 7 characters longer.

3.  So to get a readable formatting, the macros may have to be edited.
    Make a copy of each one you want, and edit it separately.

4.  I have included edited versions of the IKJTPVT and IKJCTLT macros
    in this pds, which will format the fields better than those in
    the SHOWMACS macro library.  Remember to adjust the CBMACS calling
    of these macros, through the BKSTR macro, to reflect the EDITED
    field names.  I have shown this work, in member CBMACSE.

5.  Lengths should be SPECIFICALLY specified for character fields.

        Example:  Don't allow DS C'VOLSER' to be coded.
                  Rather code DS CL6'VOLSER'

        Most IBM macros are very specific about field lengths.  The
        SHOWMACS macros may not be.  Therefore they must be edited
        to specifically show all (character) field lengths.

    Doing all of this, will make the formatted control blocks clearer
    to read, with fewer errors, and will avoid unnecessary truncation
    of the fields, as long as BKSTR can figure out all the field
    lengths correctly.
