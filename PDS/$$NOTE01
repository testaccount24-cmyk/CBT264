Important note, for the LOOK command to work:
--------- ----  --- --- ---- ------- -- ----
     This remark only applies to older versions of LOOK.
     The new versions:  LOOKN (64-bit) and LOOKJ (31-bit) run
     APF-authorized all the time, and do not allocate
     user-key common storage.

               -------------------------------------------------
                 (Note from Sam Golob:  The LOOK program needs
                  a PARMLIB setting in the active DIAGxx member:

     >>>>>>>>               VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(YES)

               This was the default until z/OS 1.8, but in
               z/OS 1.9, VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(NO) is the
               default.  It now has to be specifically set to
               VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(YES), or LOOK will abend
               with a SB0A, reason code 5C (or something similar).
               -------------------------------------------------
               If your active DIAGxx member is set to
                  VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(NO)
               and you don't want to change it, but you want to
               use LOOK for a time, use TSO command (included in
               this pds) UKEYCSA, which has to be authorized,
               to temporarily turn off the setting:
                  VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(NO)
               -------------------------------------------------
               The newest version of LOOK, member LOOKJ, does
               not try to acquire user key CSA, and therefore
               this version of LOOK does not need the PARMLIB
               setting.  This note is applicable only from
               z/OS 1.8 thru z/OS 2.3.  In 2.4, acquiring
               user key CSA will always be forbidden.
