                   SUBSTITUTION OF IBM MACROS

Introduction:

    IBM is IBM.  They don't consider user programs when they code.
And so they certainly don't consider the user program called LOOK, with
its macro formatting capabilities, when they code their macros.

    The LOOK macro formatting capabilities, can read IBM macros and
display formatted output, but only under certain conditions--conditions
that IBM certainly does not keep in mind.

EXAMPLES:

    The CBMACS macro formatting will only format a label that is next
to real data.  For example:  CBMACS will not format a label like:

LABEL    DS    0F
         DS    CL8

In this case, the label called LABEL is not pointing to real data.
On the other hand, if you had coded:

         DS    0F
LABEL    DS    CL8

then the label is pointing to real data, and that field will get
formatted.

    An extreme case of this is found in the IBM macro IEFAJCTB, which
describes the system's JCT control block (as opposed to the JES2
control block of the same name).  Whoever coded this macro, in IBM,
used DS  CLn  instructions instead of DS  XLn  instructions almost
everywhere, and as a consequence, when CBMACS tries to format these
fields, they almost all come out as unprintable, because they are not
printable characters, but hexadecimal numbers.

    So I made a copy of the macro, put it into my own dataset,
SBGOLOB.LOOK.INSTALL, and changed almost all of the C's to X's.
Below, you will see the difference in the LOOK display.

First, the display with the pure IBM macro:

LOOK COMMAND - DISPLAY VIRTUAL MEMORY      CURRENT ASID= 004B

1= HELP      2=           3= END        4=           5= REPEAT  6=
7= BACKWARD  8= FORWARD   9= HIST BWD  10= HIST FWD 11=        12=


Next, the display with the altered IBM macro, with most of the
"character constants" changed to "hex constants".

LOOK COMMAND - DISPLAY VIRTUAL MEMORY      CURRENT ASID= 004B

7= BACKWARD  8= FORWARD   9= HIST BWD  10= HIST FWD 11=        12=


    So you have to do this for whatever macros you are interested in
displaying, since IBM did not code them with the LOOK program in mind.

    Also please note that since the IBM macros are copyrighted, I could
not put the altered copies on the CBT Tape, so the best I can do, is to
put an object deck of CBMACS into this file, so that you can use the
product of my efforts.  I also mention which macros I myself have
altered.

    Best I can do.

    Good luck in formatting the macros that you are interested in.

Sincerely,    Sam                email:   sbgolob@cbttape.org


Macros altered:

IEFAJCTB IEFJMR IHAACEE IHAIPA IHAWEB IHAWUQ
IKJEFLWA IKJTPVT IKJTSVT IKJUPT

(Some of these are not IBM macros, so I can include them
in files on the CBT Tape.)
