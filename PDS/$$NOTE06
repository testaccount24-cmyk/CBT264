LOOKJ, LOOKN, etc.

LOOKN is the 64-bit version of LOOKJ, and you can see storage with it,
that is "above the bar".  Example:  Type in the address:  1FFFFF00000
LOOKN is now the preferred version of LOOK to use, if you have a z/OS
system.

Joe Reichman has fixed LOOK so that it does not obtain common storage
in a user key.  Therefore, LOOKJ can now run when the DIAGxx PARMLIB
member contains (or is defaulted to):

VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(NO)

This parameter will no longer be valid from z/OS 2.4 onward, so
from z/OS 2.4 on, you MUST use this version of LOOKJ, or LOOKN.

The downside is that LOOKJ now has to be APF-authorized, always.
Same applies to LOOKN.

I am leaving previous versions of the LOOK code, for people who are
running older operating systems.  And if you are in between from
z/OS 1.8 to z/OS 2.3, you can use the UKEYCSA program to temporarily
allow the allocation of user key CSA.

Please note that LOOK has to be assembled together with CBMACS,
which is the code that formats some control blocks.  The LOOK driver
program is what has been changed, not CBMACS.

You should assemble LOOK with CBMACS at the system level which your
system is running.  Use the SYS1.MACLIB and SYS1.MODGEN (or AMODGEN)
which is at the level that your system is running.
