A Note about LOOK and CBMACS
- ---- ----- ---- --- ------

The two programs, LOOK (i.e. LOOKN or LOOKJ) may be considered as a
"driving module" for CBMACS, which is the module that formats control
blocks.

So:

Any version of LOOK can be combined with any version of CBMACS.

Therefore:

If you've customized your version of CBMACS, and you want to upgrade
your version of LOOK, just reassemble your own version of CBMACS
with the new version of LOOK.  You should be fine.
