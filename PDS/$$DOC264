This documentation is from the original version of File 264.
LOOK was originally written, in its entirety, by Guy Albertelli,
together with the immensely clever module, CBMACS.

DUDASD was modernized by Albert Cheng, and we present his version
of DUDASD here (fixed for 4-character unit addresses, etc.).

**FILE 264 Is from BF GOODRICH of AKRON , OHIO and contains two  *
           TSO command processors and a program.                 *
           They are:                                             *
              1  LOOK    -  A TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR THAT ALLOWS  *
                            FULL SCREEN DISPLAY OF REAL TIME     *
                            MEMORY .  THIS COMMAND HAS BEEN      *
                            ENHANCED TO MAKE IT EASY TO ADD      *
                            NEW CONTROL BLOCK MAPS , USUALLY IN  *
                            3 OR 4 STATEMENTS                    *
                             * (refreshed  7/91 v1.1.E -         *
                                   functions under ESA 4.2)      *
               -------------------------------------------------
                 (Note from Sam Golob:  The LOOK program needs
                  a PARMLIB setting in the active DIAGxx member:
                  (Valid from z/OS 1.8 thru z/OS 2.3 only.)

     >>>>>>>>               VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(YES)

                  This was the default until z/OS 1.8, but in
                  z/OS 1.9, VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(NO) is the
                  default.  It now has to be specifically set to
                  VSM ALLOWUSERKEYCSA(YES), or LOOK will abend
                  with a SB0A, reason code 5C.
               -------------------------------------------------
     >>>>>>>>    The current LOOKJ was fixed by Joe Reichman to
                 not allocate CSA in a user key.  It now must
                 be APF-authorized, and it will allocate that
                 storage in Key 0 now.
