LOOK

This program has its roots in the old DCMS (Dirt Cheap Monitor System)
program package (as was DIDOCS and CSAMON). It has been made a stand-
alone program with its own screen handling.  The basic purpose that it
serves is to provide the ability to display core interactively and
in real time.  To that end it also supports the ability to display any
memory in any address space if it is run authorized.  As an aid to
the programmers that may use it, it will format MVS control blocks
in a semi-reasonable format (in pairs of name suffix, data). The
original version of LOOK requried a generated entry for each item
displayed on the screen.  This seemed an unnecessarily time wasting
and error prone event. A set of macros was written to automate the
generation of the display information necessary from the DSECT expansion
of the real macro. Thus adding a new control block is as easy as
adding 3 statements to the control block module.

I would like to thank the original authors of the DCMS system for
the original idea of LOOK. Any perceived distortions of their intent
was due to my needs.

Changes
        6/1/88  -  Fix problems with displaying core that really
         (1.1)     doesn't exist.
                -  Also fix control block output of char strings
                   to translate data - thanks to Mr. S. Golob of Newseek
                -  Support XA via a GLOBAL set symbol
      11/28/90  -  Added support from Bruce Bordonaro of Pershing
                   for many more control block formats.
                         -->  Thanks a lot, Bruce  <--
                -  Improved error recovery during memory fetch.

      Changes by Joe Reichman during 2017, to eliminate (hopefully)
      S0C4 abends when reading "BAD ADDRESSES", and to modernize
      the cross-memory access, using the IEAMSCHD macro instead of
      the SCHEDULE macro, when running the SRB's.

      02/11/19  -  Change by Joe Reichman to get all CSA storage
                   in Key 0, so as not to try and get user key CSA.
                   This change forces LOOK to always be authorized.
                   In modern systems, I guess it is a small price
                   to pay, for the continuation of the functionality.
                   From z/OS 2.4 and onward, it will become impossible
                   to get CSA in a user key.  And even before that,
                   you have to flip two bits (using the DIAGxx
                   PARMLIB member, or our TSO commad, UKEYCSA,
                   presented in this file), to allow user key CSA.
