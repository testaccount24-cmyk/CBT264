**   The new 64-bit version of LOOK is called LOOKN.
**   The revised 31-bit version of LOOK is called LOOKJ.
**   Both of these versions were developed by Joe Reichman.
** -------------------------------------------------------------------
**   The LOOK version called LOOKJ has been revised by Joe Reichman to
**   allow operation when VSM ALLOWUSERKEY(NO) is set, in the PARMLIB
**   member DIAGxx.  For cross-memory storage browsing, the SCHEDULE
**   macro has been replaced by IEAMSCHD, so this version of the
**   program may not work on old MVS systems (below OS/390 1.3).
**
**   THIS VERSION OF LOOK REQUIRES APF-AUTHORIZATON, ALWAYS.
** -------------------------------------------------------------------
**   LOOK requires assembly together with the CBMACS module, so that
**   it can format many system control blocks.  The LOOK module is the
**   "driving code", which can be assembled together with different
**   versions of CBMACS depending on any specialized needs that you
**   have, to format specific control blocks.  The CBMACS we have
**   packaged with CBT File 264, will already format many standard
**   z/OS (OS390, MVS) control blocks, but you may want to create
**   your own versions of CBMACS.
**
**   Please note:  CBMACS will only format "real data" in macros,
**   so when an IBM macro contains:   label   DS  0CLx   or similarly,
**   label  DS  0XLx  then CBMACS will not display that field.  You
**   may want to create your own altered versions of IBM macros, but
**   we can't publish them for licensing reasons.  Formatting in
**   CBMACS also depends on the data type (such as C, X, A, F, etc.)
**   You may want to alter an IBM macro from  DS CL5 to DS XL5, so
**   that the data will display in hex, instead of showing a dot,
**   when that data is not a displayable value.
**
**   Formatting is turned off, using the ONULL command in LOOK.
