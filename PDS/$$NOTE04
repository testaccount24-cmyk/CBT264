First note:

Every once in a while, LOOK will have to be reassembled to see new
fields in the system macros.  The macros will sometimes be changed
by IBM, and therefore if you want a more realistic formatting, you
have to reassemble LOOK and CBMACS, to use the newest versions of
the system macros.  (See assembly levels below.)
Assembly JCL that was used, is in member LOOK$.

Second note:

I have had difficuly with formatting the newest version of the JMR
(macro IEFJMR), because of the JMR extension that has been added to
it, and the BKSTR macro of CBMACS did not understand that properly.
Therefore, for now, I have left out the formatting of the JMR unitl
I better understand what is going on, and I can fix the assembly
error.

Third note:

I have had to change a few fields in macro IKJEFLWA so that they
would show up in the formatted view of the LWA control block.  I
could not publish the example of that on the CBT Tape, but the
changes to the z/OS 2.1 version (PUT 1405) were as follows:
